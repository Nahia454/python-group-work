#Basic
#Create a class called Car with attributes brand and color. Instantiate an object 
#of the Car class and print its attributes.
class Car:
    def __init__(self,brand,color):
     self.brand= brand
     self.color=color
    
my_car= Car(
    brand="Audi",
   color="maroon"
)
print(f"Car brand:",my_car.brand)
print(f"Car color:",my_car.color)




#intmediate
#Add a method called start_engine to the Car class that prints a 
#message saying the engine of the car has started. Create an instance of Car and call 
#the method.
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
    def start_engine(self):
        print(f"The engine of the {self.year} {self.make} {self.model} has started.")
my_car=Car("Suzuki","Maruti","2023")
my_car.start_engine()




#Advanced
# class BankAccount:with attributes account_number and balance. Add methods to:
#Deposit an amount.
#Withdraw an amount (only if sufficient balance exists).
#Print the account balance.

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance=0):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited: {amount}. New balance: {self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Deposit amount must be positive.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > 0 and amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew: {amount}. New balance: {self.balance}")
        elif amount > self.balance:

#Challenge
#Implement a class called Library that manages a collection of books
# Each book has a title, author, and available status. The Library class should have
#methods to:
#Add a book to the library.
#Remove a book from the library.
#Check if a book is available by title.
#Borrow a book (mark it as unavailable if itâ€™s available).
#Return a book (mark it as available again if it was borrowed).
